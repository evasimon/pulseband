    This is my first responsive web page that I have hand coded (mobile-first approach) for an innovative Pulseband technology mock-up project during my design bootcamp at DESIGNATION Labs.

    The live web page can be visited @ http://evasimon.me/pulseband/

The Pulseband is a new wearable monitor that measures a wearer’s blood pressure, heart rate, steps, sleep patterns among other vitals. The wearable monitor is a sleek wristband that turns different colors to indicate the wearer’s progress/status based on their profile. It is differentiated from standard sports fitness monitors by being specifically designed to also accommodate people with certain heart conditions.

One of the objective of the project was to design and develop a functional product description responsive web page prototype using HTML/CSS & JavaScript that describe the Pulseband and it’s companion apps’ benefits.
